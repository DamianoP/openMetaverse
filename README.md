# openMetaverse

In this repository there is a project to create a metaverse, an immersive environment with voice and text chat.

The project is developed by the research group of the University of Perugia <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/damiano-perri-6938b893/">Damiano Perri</a>, <a href="https://ogervasi.unipg.it/">Osvaldo Gervasi</a> and <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Marco-Simonetti-6">Marco Simonetti</a>.
The project was originally initiated by Riccardo Bellavista who programmed and developed the code for his thesis work.
